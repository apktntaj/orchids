Below is a **1-week focused accounting study plan**, **strictly scoped to your Orchid Dates role**.
No theory for theory’s sake. Every item maps to tasks you already receive.

# 7-Day Accounting Plan (Operational, Not Academic)

## Daily rule (important)

**Study 60–90 minutes max/day.**
End each day by asking: *“What mistake does this help me avoid?”*

---

## DAY 1 — The Accounting Skeleton (Mental Model)

**Goal:** Understand what an invoice *does* to the business.

Learn:

* The 5 buckets you operate in:

  * Revenue
  * Accounts Receivable (AR)
  * Inventory
  * COGS
  * Cash (later, when paid)
* The chain:

  ```
  Shipment → Invoice → AR ↑ → Inventory ↓ → COGS ↑
  ```

Practice (10 minutes):

* Take one real invoice you created.
* Answer verbally:

  * Who owes money now?
  * What inventory moved?
  * What reports changed?

Deliverable to yourself:

* One paragraph explaining why invoices are accounting, not admin.

---

## DAY 2 — Accounts Receivable (AR) That Owners Care About

**Goal:** Prevent cash surprises.

Learn:

* What AR is (money owed, not money received)
* AR Aging:

  * Current
  * 30 / 60 / 90+
* Why owners look at **aging**, not totals

Practice:

* Open AR Aging report in QBO.
* Pick one overdue customer.
* Explain *why* it matters operationally.

Mistake this prevents:

* Invoicing wrong customer
* Thinking sales = cash

---

## DAY 3 — Inventory as an Asset (Your Highest Risk Area)

**Goal:** Stop silent damage.

Learn:

* Inventory = asset until sold
* Invoice reduces inventory automatically
* Wrong product = wrong inventory math

Practice:

* Compare:

  * Inventory Summary
  * Sales by Product
* Ask:

  * Does stock reduction match shipments?

Mistake this prevents:

* Season mixing
* Duplicate SKUs
* “Inventory looks fine” lies

---

## DAY 4 — COGS (Only What You Need)

**Goal:** Understand cost impact without journal entries.

Learn:

* COGS = cost of what was sold
* Why COGS accuracy depends on:

  * correct product
  * correct season
* Why owners don’t want COGS surprises

Practice:

* Take one product.
* Trace:

  * purchase → inventory → sale → COGS

Mistake this prevents:

* Profit reports that look good but aren’t real

---

## DAY 5 — Reports Owners Actually Read

**Goal:** Know where lies appear first.

Learn these reports only:

* Profit & Loss (P&L)
* AR Aging
* Inventory Summary

Practice:

* For each report, answer:

  * “What decision would an owner make from this?”

Mistake this prevents:

* Blind trust in reports
* Missing early warning signs

---

## DAY 6 — Error Classification (Accounting Judgment)

**Goal:** Know when to stop.

Learn:

* Recoverable vs Dangerous errors:

  * Formatting → recoverable
  * Customer, product, season → dangerous

Practice:

* Review 3 old invoices.
* Classify each issue:

  * cosmetic
  * accounting-impacting

Mistake this prevents:

* Repeating “small” but critical errors

---

## DAY 7 — Owner Simulation (Final Integration)

**Goal:** Think like the reviewer.

Exercise:

* Pretend you are the owner.
* Review:

  * one invoice
  * AR aging
  * inventory summary
* Ask:

  * “Where could this be wrong without me noticing?”

Deliverable:

* One checklist item you’ll add to your workflow next week.

---

## What you should **not** study this week

Ignore completely:

* Debit / credit drills
* Journal entries
* Accrual theory
* CPA materials
* Tax law

They will **not** improve your performance now.

---

## Success definition (very important)

After this week, you should be able to say:

> “I know exactly how a single invoice affects money, inventory, and trust.”

That is **real accounting skill** for your role.
