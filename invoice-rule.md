# Orchid Dates — Invoice Checklist

**(Use this before & during every invoice)**

---

## A. STOP — Before Opening QuickBooks

☐ I have the **BOL**
☐ I have read the BOL **top to bottom**
☐ Shipment date is clear
☐ “Bill To” is clearly identified

> If any box above is unchecked → **STOP**

---

## B. Customer Verification (Non-Negotiable)

☐ Customer = **Bill To** on BOL
☐ Legal name spelled correctly
☐ State address is correct
☐ Matches an existing QBO customer

> Never default to “Ship To”

---

## C. Product & Shipment Understanding

☐ I know how many **pallets** shipped
☐ I know what each pallet contains
☐ I can describe the shipment in **one sentence**

Product identity confirmed using:

* ☐ Box size (lbs)
* ☐ Grade (Large / Jumbo / etc.)
* ☐ Season (2024 / 2025)

---

## D. Pallet → Box Sanity Check (Validation Only)

☐ I compared box counts against pallet mapping
☐ Difference is:

* ☐ Reasonable → proceed + note
* ☐ Impossible → **STOP & VERIFY**

> Mapping validates.
> BOL remains source of truth.

---

## E. Invoice Line Logic (Still No QBO)

☐ One line = **one product identity**
☐ Same product across pallets = merged quantity
☐ Different box size or season = separate line
☐ Pallet numbers did NOT define line structure

---

## F. QuickBooks Entry (In This Order)

☐ Customer selected first (Bill To)
☐ Invoice date = shipment date
☐ Correct existing products used (no duplicates)
☐ Quantities entered in **boxes**
☐ Line count looks clean and reasonable
☐ BOL attached
☐ Internal note added if needed

---

## G. Final 10-Second Owner Check

Ask yourself:

> “If I were the owner, would this invoice be
> immediately understandable and trustworthy?”

☐ Yes → Save
☐ No → Fix now

---

## The One Rule That Overrides Everything

> **If you are unsure about money, inventory, or legal identity — stop and verify.
> If it’s style — fix and move on.**

---

### How to use this checklist

* Read **top to bottom**
* Never skip sections
* Over time, this becomes instinct

---

If you want, next we can:

* stress-test this checklist with **edge cases**, or
* translate this into **QuickBooks “do / never do” rules**, or
* build a **weekly self-audit routine** (10 minutes).

Tell me which one you want next.
