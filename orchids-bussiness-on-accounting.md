# 5-Minute Accounting Explanation of Orchid Dates

> “Orchid Dates is an inventory-based trading business with delayed cash realization.”



1. How the Business Makes Money (Revenue Recognition)

“Revenue is recognized when dates are delivered or invoiced, not when cash is received.

Most sales are on invoice terms, so revenue often appears before cash hits the bank.
That creates Accounts Receivable, which we monitor through A/R aging.”

Accounting terms used:

Accrual basis

Revenue recognition

Accounts Receivable

2. How Costs Flow (COGS Logic)

“The main cost is inventory (dates + packaging + freight).
These costs sit on the Balance Sheet as Inventory, not as expense.

COGS is recognized only when inventory is sold, using FIFO, because dates are perishable and older stock must be expensed first.”

Accounting terms used:

Inventory as asset

Cost of Goods Sold

FIFO

3. Why Profit ≠ Cash

“Profit shows business performance, not liquidity.

We can be profitable while cash is low because:

Customers haven’t paid yet (A/R)

Inventory is still unsold

Bills to suppliers are not due yet


That’s why we track P&L, Balance Sheet, AR aging, and AP aging together.”

Accounting terms used:

Profit vs cash

Working capital

Accrual mismatch

4. What Risks Exist in This Business

“The biggest accounting risks are:

Old receivables → fake profit

Inventory overstatement → fake margin

Late bill recognition → surprise expenses


So the control points are:

AR aging over 30/60/90 days

Inventory valuation accuracy

Monthly close discipline”


Accounting terms used:

Overstatement

Controls

Monthly close

5. How Management Decisions Are Supported

“With clean books, you can decide:

Which customers are worth keeping

Whether margins are improving or shrinking

When cash pressure is coming before it hits


My role is to keep the numbers accurate, timely, and comparable month to month, so decisions are based on reality, not assumptions.”

Accounting terms used:

Margin analysis

Comparability

Decision support
