Below is a **clean, owner-grade summary** of our discussion so far, focused **only on Orchid Dates’ business flow**, not tools.

You can treat this as your **mental SOP**.

# Orchid Dates – Business Flow Summary (Operational View)

## 1. Core Principle (Foundation)

> **Business reality comes first.
> Software only records it.**

When something is unclear:

* You stop at reality (documents, shipment)
* You do **not** guess in QuickBooks

---

## 2. Source of Truth Hierarchy

Truth flows in **one direction only**:

```
Physical shipment
→ Bill of Lading (BOL)
→ Invoice logic
→ QuickBooks entry
→ Reports & Excel summaries
```

* BOL overrides QuickBooks
* QuickBooks never “fixes” the BOL
* Reports never fix QuickBooks

---

## 3. Roles on a BOL (Critical Distinction)

A BOL contains **multiple parties**:

* **Shipper** → Orchid Dates (never the customer)
* **Ship To** → logistics receiver (warehouse / sister company)
* **Bill To** → **legal & financial obligation**
* **Carrier / Driver** → operational only

### Rule:

> **Customer in QuickBooks = “Bill To” on the BOL**

Never default to “Ship To” if they differ.

---

## 4. Pre-Invoice Checklist (Before Opening QuickBooks)

You must be certain of **three things**:

1. **When**

   * Shipment date (not invoice creation date)

2. **Who**

   * Correct legal customer
   * Exact name + correct state
   * Especially important with sister companies

3. **What**

   * What physically shipped:

     * pallets
     * box sizes
     * grades
     * season

If any of these are unclear → stop and verify.

---

## 5. Product Identity (Non-Negotiable)

At Orchid Dates, a **product identity** is defined by:

```
Season + Grade + Box Size
```

Optionally:

* Top type (White / Red), if treated distinctly

### Rules:

* Same product identity → **one invoice line**
* Different box size → **different product**
* Different season → **different product**
* Same pallet does NOT merge products

---

## 6. Pallet vs Product (Key Mental Model)

> **Pallets are containers.
> Products are what you sell.**

* One pallet can contain multiple products
* One product can span multiple pallets
* Invoice lines are built on **product identity**, not pallets

---

## 7. Pallet → Box Mapping (Validation Tool)

You were given standard capacity notes, e.g.:

* 11 lb pallet ≈ 200 boxes
* 4 lb pallet ≈ 448 boxes
* etc.

### Purpose:

* **Sanity check**, not override
* Detect impossible or suspicious quantities

### How to use:

* Small variance → proceed + add note
* Impossible variance → stop and verify

> **BOL remains the source of truth.
> Mapping is only a validation lens.**

---

## 8. Professional Decision Rule

> **Small difference → document.
> Big difference → verify.
> Never “fix” numbers to make them look right.**

Stopping to verify is professional.
Guessing is not.

---

## 9. What This Flow Protects

This workflow prevents:

* invoicing the wrong legal entity
* inventory corruption
* AR confusion
* expensive cleanup later

From an owner’s view, this protects:

* **cash flow**
* **trust**
* **decision quality**

---

If you want, next we can:

1. Turn this into a **1-page daily SOP**, or
2. Walk **step-by-step invoice construction** from a real BOL → QuickBooks, or
3. Do a **“common mistake → consequence” map** so you know what errors are recoverable and which are not.

Tell me which one you want to do next.
